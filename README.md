# Automated setup of tmux sessions, windows, and panes

## The problem

To save the time lost to building the same tmux sessions every morning after each overnight system crash on my dying computer.

## The solution

A bash function called `twf`, **t**umx **w**ork **f**low. 
Enter `twf` and go get some coffee while your computer prepares your workflow for the day.
This approach could save 50-200 keystrokes per day.


## Usage

```bash
chmod +x tmux.sh
source ./tmux.sh # add to your .zshrc file eventually.
twf
```

## Requirements

- Mac OS but adaptable to other platforms.
- iterm2
- `advanced-tmux.config` from the [MooersLab/tmux-rocks](https://github.com/MooersLab/tmux-rocks) repo.
- Current version of tmux (install with home brew).
- Current version of tmux-plugin-manager.
- AppleScript
- A text editor to customize the `tmux.sh`.

## Example of autogenerated ten tmux windows in one iterm2 tab

![10windowsWeather](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a649d6f-aaf6-455e-a78a-ab66606035f9)

Five iterm2 tabs were created and populated with five tmux sessions.
The current window is the highlighted tmux tab.
There is a ten-window limit per iterm2 tab.
